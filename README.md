# Kata for improving Reactive Programming
In reactive/asynchronous programming event changes are propagated to the registered consumer which then react to the
data that comes in.
In this kata ReactiveX is taken in account. ReactiveX is an API for asynchronous programming with observable streams.
It is also a cross-platform API. Since Java is applied, more exactly RxJava, the implementation of ReactiveX-API is used.
